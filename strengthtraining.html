        <pre>Aight, lifting is the wave. If you're scared that you're going to gain too much muscle
        mass and lose your running fitness, I assure you that you won't. The running that you do
        will prevent your muscles from gaining too much mass.

             Basically, strength training helps out with running economy, which is the efficiency at which you
            consume oxygen to utilize your muscles. It can also help prevent injury although you aren’t completely
            injury-free if you strength train, you just reduce the risk of getting hurt. Also stronger legs give you
            more power which is essential as the more power you drive into the ground, the further your stride
            length which leads to faster running. If that doesn’t convince you then it’s cool, but I personally
            think people reach their maximum potential when they incorporate strength training.
            I ran for four years without strength training and was on the slower end and would constantly have
            some kind of issue, but when I started during my freshman year of college, everything changed for
            the better. Also, it increases bone density.
            Dense bones = strong bones = no need to drink milk(nah jk that’s a whole other discussion do what you want there).
