        <p>Before you do anything rate your pain 1 to 10. If it is greater than 6,
            TAKE A WEEK OFF AND PERFORM SUGGESTED STRENGTH MOVEMENTS. Try running
            very lightly after a week and if it still hurts, see a professional or take another
            week off of running while performing strength movements. Trust me, this is better than
            running through it, I know it's hard but in the long run (hehe) this is significantly
            better for you, and some people have breakthroughs after taking rest.</p>
        <p>If your pain is above an 8, see a professional immediately and take complete rest
            from running until a professional suggests otherwise.</p>
        <p> Otherwise, if it doesn't hurt when you get warmed up, lighten your training intensity slightly(reduce
            mileage,
            lighten speed workouts) for about a week.</p>
        <p>For all suggested exercises/movements, a resistance band is optional where applicable.
            If it's too much do NOT use it. </p>

    <article id="GenCause">
        <h2 class="musclehead">General Causes of Pains/Injuries</h2>
        <p>In general, through my research and personal experience, I have found that
            injuries and pains are triggered by a sudden increase in training volume or intensity,
            incorrect form, incorrect foot strike, muscle imbalances, footwear that does not accommodate
            for your feet, or a combination of these factors. </p>
        <h3 class="musclehead">Increase In Volume/Intensity</h3>
        <p> If you recently kicked up your
            training volume by more than 10% than the previous week, or you did a workout without
            proper base training and insufficient recovery, your issue could be an unexpected
            increase in volume/intensity that your body has not reacted to well</p>
        <h3 class="musclehead">Incorrect Form/Foot Strike</h3>
        <p>I suggest taking a video of yourself doing strides and comparing your form
            with a pro, see how they strike the ground, how they use their arms, how
            their feet/legs extend, etc. There are drills to work on form however this can take
            a while. I personally have been trying to perfect my form for 4 years and I have
            made progress, but I'm not there yet. That may seem like a long
            time, but I have really only been focusing on it the past year, and it could definitely take a shorter
            amount of time for others.</p>
        <h3 class="musclehead">Improper footwear</h3>
        <p>Footwear is essential for a runner regardless of what distance they train for.
            Your feet and personal preferences are unique to you, and there are different shoes
            that accommodate for different factors. If you go to a running store and ask an employee
            to help you out, they will likely know what type of footwear is best for you and
            whether you would need any extra accommodations. </p>

        <section>
            <h3 class="musclehead">The Cause</h3>
            <p> Weak hips, Weak glutes. </p>
            <p> How you run
                along a track. In workouts, many people tend to traverse the track
                counter-clockwise, which can put stress on one side of your body.
                So, varying your direction after sets or reps can assist in your recovery
                or relief of this pain.

        <h2 class="musclehead">Peroneal/Fibularis Tendonitis</h2>
        <section>
            <h3 class="musclehead">The Cause</h3>
            <p> Weak hip abductors, Weak calves, weak peroneal. </p>
            <p>
                A likely cause of this is awkward movements
                of your feet caused by the terrain you run in. If you run in uneven footing, it's likely
                that this could trigger the tendonitis especially if you're rolling your ankles
                .
